==== Exception State ====
SWC ID: 110
Severity: Low
Contract: 0x1C94a88286E7505e5d505AF8779F5BF87DBED9C1
Function name: proposalsOfMembers(address,uint256)
PC address: 2469
Estimated Gas Usage: 736 - 1021
A reachable exception has been detected.
It is possible to trigger an exception (opcode 0xfe). Exceptions can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. Note that explicit `assert()` should only be used to check invariants. Use `require()` for regular input checking.
